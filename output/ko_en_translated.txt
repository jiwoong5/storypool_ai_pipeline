April 30, 2025, clear. Today the sky is unusually clear. There's no sun coming out of the window, and there's no silence on my desk. I'm sitting there waiting for a cup of coffee to drop down and give me a moment's notice. It's been a long time since I felt like I had a good moment without doing anything, and I'm going for a walk in the afternoon. In the middle of the park, there is a deep scent from the lilac flower. I'm looking for a spring picnic that's going to give the smell all the time. Deep down in my heart, I don't feel anything warm. Every day is passing too fast these days. Even though the circle is not going to be a big deal, the things that have to be done in the evening are still on the list. But today I just want to say that this day is naked. I don't know how a day that never happened feels so precious, maybe it's enough.
